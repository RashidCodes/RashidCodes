# Hey thereðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my portfolio. I'm Rashid Mohammed, a Master of Applied Data Science graduate from the University of Southern Queensland (USQ) in Australia. I'm looking to collaborate with experienced data scientists, software developers, etc. to help businesses leverage the power of their data in their decision-making processes. I'm also looking to gain some industry experience from highly experienced professionals in data.  I have experience with machine learning, exploratory data analysis, multivariate statistics, hypothesis testing, data mining, and several others. I'm currently learning how to build decentralised applications on the Ethereum blockchain.
