# Hey thereðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my portfolio. I'm Rashid Mohammed, a Master of Applied Data Science graduate from the University of Southern Queensland (USQ) in Australia. I only recently graduated so I'm looking for any entry to mid-level data analyst, data scientist, data engineer, or python developer roles. I'm looking to collaborate with experienced data scientists, software developers, etc. to help businesses leverage the power of their data in their decision-making processes. I'm also looking to gain some industry experience for highly experienced professionals in data.  I have experience with machine learning, exploratory data analysis, multivariate statistics, hypothesis testing, data mining, and several others. I'm currently working on levelling up my SQL skills with a book from *Itzik Ben-Gan* titled **Transact-SQL Fundamentals**. It's an awesome book and I definitely recommend it to any beginner or someone like me who's just looking to refresh their SQL skills. Check out my repo [T-SQL fundametals](https://github.com/RashidCodes/T-SQL_Fundamentals) to see my progress with SQL so far. 

I've also just started making youtube videos because it's something I've always wanted to try. Now that I'm done with Uni, I guess I don't have any excuses. Lastly, I just started my [blog](kingmoh.hashnode.dev).

## Fun fact
I can't believe I graduated with a distinction in Applied Data Science. I've never considered myself to be smart enough but I guess hardwork pays off eventually. Although I'm done with Uni, I know the learning never really stops in data science. Please check out my repos if you can, and if you find anthing interesting, please don't hesitate to hit me up on Linkedin. It'll be a pleasure to have a chat.
